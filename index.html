      <h1>The project</h1>
      <section>
        <p>
          This project was undertaken as part of an academic assessment for the
          "Information and Technology Skills" course instructed by Professor
          Valentina Presutti. This particular course is included in the
          international Master's program titled "Language, Society, and
          Communication" at the University of Bologna. It was carried out by 3
          Russian-speaking girls studying at the University of Bologna -
          Valeriia Ogorodnikova, Anastasiia Hulevych and Alena Nagovitcyna.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project focuses on developing a data story on the "Melody"
          website, which centers around music and its historical significance.
          Our project comprises two stories, one dedicated to the Beatles and
          the other to Joy Division. Drawing inspiration from the field of data
          journalism, we conducted extensive data analysis to craft compelling
          narratives.
        </p>
        <p>
          To accomplish this, we utilized the Polifonia corpora and the Corpus
          interrogation tool to explore the data in depth. We also delved into
          the vast knowledge graph of Wikidata, leveraging SPARQL queries to
          gather relevant information. By employing a data-driven approach, we
          unearthed intriguing facts and formulated hypotheses that we then
          tested and substantiated using the available data.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have approached this task from two different angles: one involved
          delving into the data itself, uncovering intriguing facts, while the
          other entailed formulating hypotheses and questions and then employing
          data to test and substantiate them. Crafting these stories has been an
          engrossing and demanding journey on the Melody platform, which has
          taken us far beyond our usual realm of study. It has served as an
          opportunity to venture outside our comfort zone and broaden our
          knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creating the stories on the Melody platform has been an engaging and
          challenging experience, expanding our knowledge beyond our usual areas
          of study. To ensure wider accessibility, we have published our website
          on GitHub. The website features two articles that encapsulate the
          essence of our stories and provide the academic foundation for our
          project. Additionally, it hosts a comprehensive project report that
          details the methodology employed throughout the creation process.
        </p>
        <p>
          The report provides a thorough description of each step of the
          project, including the tools utilized, such as the Melody website and
          other relevant resources. It also discusses the challenges encountered
          during the project and the strategies we employed to overcome them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, the Melody project has been a journey of exploration and
          learning, allowing us to venture outside our comfort zone and expand
          our understanding of music history through the lens of data analysis
          and storytelling.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are happy to present our Melody stories:
