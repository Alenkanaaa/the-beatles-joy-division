        <h2>STEP 1: Creation of a Melody Story</h2>
        <p>
          Creating a Melody story on the Melody website using knowledge graphs
          can be an engaging way to present information and explore a specific
          topic. In our case, the chosen themes were "The Beatles" and “Joy
          Division”, we aimed to showcase their history, members, and influences
          within a specific time period.
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin, we created a Melody account on the website and started the
          process of crafting our data story. By selecting the theme as "The
          Beatles" and “Joy Division” we set the focus of our project on these 2
          iconic bands. Our hypothesis was that both bands had a significant
          impact on the mentality and culture of people worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          To support our hypothesis, we utilized SPARQL queries to search the
          WIKIDATA database. WIKIDATA is a collaborative knowledge graph that
          contains structured data from various sources, including Wikipedia. By
          referencing pre-established codes within WIKIDATA (such as country
          codes), we constructed queries following the examples provided by your
          professor.
        </p>
        <p>
          After checking the validity of our queries on WIKIDATA, we implemented
          them on the Melody website. The website offers various templates and
          visualization options like count, line charts, doughnut charts,
          tables, etc. Once our queries retrieved the desired information
          accurately, we arranged and presented the data in a coherent
          storyline.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the process, we used different types of queries based on
          the specific information we required. For instance, we explored the
          bands’ histories, their personal lives, and their fame. Each time, we
          followed the process of checking the relevant code on WIKIDATA,
          constructing a search query to extract the desired data, verifying the
          obtained information, and finally incorporating it into the Melody
          website. By following this methodology, we were able to create a
          Melody story centered around "The Beatles" and “Joy Division” by
          utilizing knowledge graphs and the resources provided by WIKIDATA.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>STEP 2: Writing an article</h2>
        <p>
          Once we completed the story on the Melody website, our next step was
          to gather academic papers that would reinforce our hypothesis and
          provide a deeper understanding of the theme. These scholarly sources
          would serve as a foundation for writing a comprehensive articles about
          "The Beatles” and “Joy Division” and their cultural impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our search for bibliographic content led us to discover a wealth of
          valuable resources that allowed us to delve into the fascinating story
          of this iconic bands. After thoroughly studying the material and
          gaining profound insights, we embarked on the process of crafting our
          article.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drawing from the knowledge acquired through extensive research, we
          delved into the realm of bands within this genre and explored the
          profound influence they exerted on society. The resulting article can
          be accessed on the designated "article" page of this website,
          presenting a thorough analysis of the impact of "The Beatles" and “Joy
          Division” and their genres on a national scale.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Step 3: HTML codes</h2>
        <p>
          For titles, we utilized the "h1" tag and for subtitles we used the
          "h2" tag.
        </p>
        <p>
          For each page content we used the semantic "section" tag and
          paragraphs were represented by the "p" tag.Additionally, we
          implemented a navigation bar to enhance the user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the development process, we relied on the tutorials provided by
          our professor, which were sourced from the W3Schools website. These
          tutorials proved invaluable in guiding us through the creation of the
          necessary codes. Once all the codes were completed, we saved the file
          with the .html extension.
        </p>
        <p>
          By leveraging HTML and the guidance of our professor's recommended
          resources, we successfully constructed our webpage on the GitHub
          platform.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Step 4: GitHub website</h2>
        <p>
          Once we established our GitHub account, we proceeded to create a
          collaborative repository titled "the-beatles" to facilitate teamwork
          and publish our website. We uploaded the HTML files and meticulously
          made the necessary final adjustments to ensure the website's quality
          and functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon completing these modifications, we published the website by
          navigating to the "settings" section of the repository. In this
          section, we carefully selected the appropriate source and branch that
          we intended to utilize for the website's deployment. To ensure
          adherence to project guidelines, we diligently followed the
          instructions provided.
        </p>
        <p>
          By following this process, we successfully uploaded our website to the
          chosen repository on GitHub, thereby making it accessible to the
          intended audience.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Step 5: Slide presentation</h2>
        <p>
          As the concluding step of our project, we prepared a slide
          presentation encompassing an overview of the Melody story, the
          methodology employed, the tools utilized, and our final conclusions.
          This presentation served as a comprehensive summary of our project's
          findings and insights.
        </p>
        <p>
          To ensure effective communication of our work, we scheduled the
          presentation for the 9th of June, allowing ample time for adequate
          preparation and delivery. This presentation served as an opportunity
          to showcase the culmination of our efforts and share our project's
          outcomes with our intended audience.

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Undertaking this project presented us with novel and unfamiliar
          territory. The tools we encountered were new to us, and understanding
          their functionality proved to be a struggle. Additionally, we
          encountered various challenges while working with the Polifonia
          Corpus. We encountered difficulties in finding sufficient data, and
          there were instances where the website indicated the presence of data,
          but it failed to display any relevant information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working with WIKIDATA also posed its own set of challenges. Despite
          conducting thorough research on the main website, we often faced
          discrepancies when executing queries. The information retrieved did
          not always align with our expectations, and there were instances of
          incomplete or missing data.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dearth of data within the provided tools was significant enough to
          prompt us to change our project theme. Initially, we intended to
          compare Russian and Ukrainian songs, but the limited information
          available in the Polifonia Corpus and the challenges faced with
          WIKIDATA queries made it unfeasible. Creating the Melody story proved
          to be a demanding task. It required numerous hours of dedicated effort
          to comprehend its workings fully. Some queries that yielded results on
          the WIKIDATA query interface did not produce the same outcome on the
          Melody website. Consequently, we had to modify our queries multiple
          times or, in some cases, abandon certain information altogether due to
          the query's inability to be processed. Furthermore, developing the
          HTML files posed complexities as we lacked familiarity with this
          aspect of web development. While this project may be straightforward
          for individuals experienced with the tools we employed, for us, it
          presented a steep learning curve.

        <p>
          Despite the challenges encountered throughout this project, it
          provided us with a valuable opportunity to explore the realms of
          music, data, and technology. We acquired new information, honed our
          skills, and expanded our understanding in these domains. While the
          project diverged from our previous experiences, it proved to be an
          enriching endeavor, enabling us to grow professionally and
          intellectually.
